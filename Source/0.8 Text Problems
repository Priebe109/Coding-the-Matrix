# Functional invers
#

Problem 0.8.6
A:  Yes (one-to-one and onto)

Problem 0.8.7
A:  No (one-to-one but NOT onto)

#
# Functional composition
#

Problem 0.8.8
A:  Yes, g o f is legal since the image of f (positive values) are contained in the domain of g (R)

    e.g. g o f = g(f(x))
    4 -> 2
   -4 -> 2
    0 -> 0
    9 -> 3

Problem 0.8.9
A:  Yes
    
    f o g
    1 -> 23
    2 -> 22
    3 -> 21

# Probability

Problem 0.8.10
A:  The function is invertible, therefor - probability of output: Pr(2) = 0.5, Pr(3) = 0.2, Pr(4) = Pr(5) = Pr(6) = 0.1
    
    Using the fundamental principle of probability:
    Pr('even number') = Pr(2) + Pr(4) + Pr(6) = 0.5 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.7
    Pr('odd number') = Pr(3) + Pr(5) = 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3

Problem 0.8.11
A:  The function is not invertible (not one-to-one)
    Probability of outputs calculated using known probability of inputs (not uniform)
    
    Pr_o(0) = Pr_i(3) + Pr_i(6) = 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3
    Pr_o(1) = Pr_i(1) + Pr_i(4) + Pr_i(7) = 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.4
    Pr_o(2) = Pr_i(2) + Pr_i(5) = 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3
